  abstract = {We use a new, unsupervised multivariate imaging and analysis strategy
	to identify related patterns of reduced white matter integrity, measured
	with the fractional anisotropy (FA) derived from diffusion tensor
	imaging (DTI), and decreases in cortical thickness, measured by high
	resolution T1-weighted imaging, in Alzheimer's disease (AD) and frontotemporal
	dementia (FTD). This process is based on a novel computational model
	derived from sparse canonical correlation analysis (SCCA) that allows
	us to automatically identify mutually predictive, distributed neuroanatomical
	regions from different imaging modalities. We apply the SCCA model
	to a dataset that includes 23 control subjects that are demographically
	matched to 49 subjects with autopsy or CSF-biomarker-diagnosed AD
	(n=24) and FTD (n=25) with both DTI and T1-weighted structural imaging.
	SCCA shows that the FTD-related frontal and temporal degeneration
	pattern is correlated across modalities with permutation corrected
	p<0.0005. In AD, we find significant association between cortical
	thinning and reduction in white matter integrity within a distributed
	parietal and temporal network (p<0.0005). Furthermore, we show that-within
	SCCA identified regions-significant differences exist between FTD
	and AD cortical-connective degeneration patterns. We validate these
	distinct, multimodal imaging patterns by showing unique relationships
	with cognitive measures in AD and FTD. We conclude that SCCA is a
	potentially valuable approach in image analysis that can be applied
	productively to distinguishing between neurodegenerative conditions.},

  abstract = {The United States National Institutes of Health (NIH) commit significant
	support to open-source data and software resources in order to foment
	reproducibility in the biomedical imaging sciences. Here, we report
	and evaluate a recent product of this commitment: Advanced Neuroimaging
	Tools (ANTs), which is approaching its 2.0 release. The ANTs open
	source software library consists of a suite of state-of-the-art image
	registration, segmentation and template building tools for quantitative
	morphometric analysis. In this work, we use ANTs to quantify, for
	the first time, the impact of similarity metrics on the affine and
	deformable components of a template-based normalization study. We
	detail the ANTs implementation of three similarity metrics: squared
	intensity difference, a new and faster cross-correlation, and voxel-wise
	mutual information. We then use two-fold cross-validation to compare
	their performance on openly available, manually labeled, T1-weighted
	MRI brain image data of 40 subjects (UCLA's LPBA40 dataset). We report
	evaluation results on cortical and whole brain labels for both the
	affine and deformable components of the registration. Results indicate
	that the best ANTs methods are competitive with existing brain extraction
	results (Jaccard=0.958) and cortical labeling approaches. Mutual
	information affine mapping combined with cross-correlation diffeomorphic
	mapping gave the best cortical labeling results (Jaccard=0.669Â±0.022).
	Furthermore, our two-fold cross-validation allows us to quantify
	the similarity of templates derived from different subgroups. Our
	open code, data and evaluation scripts set performance benchmark
	parameters for this state-of-the-art toolkit. This is the first study
	to use a consistent transformation framework to provide a reproducible
	evaluation of the isolated effect of the similarity metric on optimal
	template construction and brain labeling.},

  title = {An Open Source Multivariate Framework for n-Tissue Segmentation with
	Evaluation on Public Data.},
  journal = {Neuroinformatics},
  year = {2011},
  month = {Mar},
  abstract = {We introduce Atropos, an ITK-based multivariate n-class open source
	segmentation algorithm distributed with ANTs ( http://www.picsl.upenn.edu/ANTs
	). The Bayesian formulation of the segmentation problem is solved
	using the Expectation Maximization (EM) algorithm with the modeling
	of the class intensities based on either parametric or non-parametric
	finite mixtures. Atropos is capable of incorporating spatial prior
	probability maps (sparse), prior label maps and/or Markov Random
	Field (MRF) modeling. Atropos has also been efficiently implemented
	to handle large quantities of possible labelings (in the experimental
	section, we use up to 69 classes) with a minimal memory footprint.
	This work describes the technical and implementation aspects of Atropos
	and evaluates its performance on two different ground-truth datasets.
	First, we use the BrainWeb dataset from Montreal Neurological Institute
	to evaluate three-tissue segmentation performance via (1) K-means
	segmentation without use of template data; (2) MRF segmentation with
	initialization by prior probability maps derived from a group template;
	(3) Prior-based segmentation with use of spatial prior probability
	maps derived from a group template. We also evaluate Atropos performance
	by using spatial priors to drive a 69-class EM segmentation problem
	derived from the Hammers atlas from University College London. These
	evaluation studies, combined with illustrative examples that exercise
	Atropos options, demonstrate both performance and wide applicability
	of this new platform-independent open source segmentation tool.},

  abstract = {We evaluate the impact of template choice on template-based segmentation
	of the hippocampus in epilepsy. Four dataset-specific strategies
	are quantitatively contrasted: the "closest to average" individual
	template, the average shape version of the closest to average template,
	a best appearance template and the best appearance and shape template
	proposed here and implemented in the open source toolkit Advanced
	Normalization Tools (ANTS). The cross-correlation similarity metric
	drives the correspondence model and is used consistently to determine
	the optimal appearance. Minimum shape distance in the diffeomorphic
	space determines optimal shape. Our evaluation results show that,
	with respect to gold-standard manual labeling of hippocampi in epilepsy,
	optimal shape and appearance template construction outperforms the
	other strategies for gaining data-derived templates. Our results
	also show the improvement is most significant on the diseased side
	and insignificant on the healthy side. Thus, the importance of the
	template increases when used to study pathology and may be less critical
	for normal control studies. Furthermore, explicit geometric optimization
	of the shape component of the unbiased template positively impacts
	the study of diseased hippocampi.},

  abstract = {Cortical thickness is an important biomarker for image-based studies
	of the brain. A diffeomorphic registration based cortical thickness
	(DiReCT) measure is introduced where a continuous one-to-one correspondence
	between the gray matter-white matter interface and the estimated
	gray matter-cerebrospinal fluid interface is given by a diffeomorphic
	mapping in the image space. Thickness is then defined in terms of
	a distance measure between the interfaces of this sheet like structure.
	This technique also provides a natural way to compute continuous
	estimates of thickness within buried sulci by preventing opposing
	gray matter banks from intersecting. In addition, the proposed method
	incorporates neuroanatomical constraints on thickness values as part
	of the mapping process. Evaluation of this method is presented on
	synthetic images. As an application to brain images, a longitudinal
	study of thickness change in frontotemporal dementia (FTD) spectrum
	disorder is reported.},
