	Abstract = {In this paper we propose a diffeomorphic non-rigid registration algorithm based on free-form deformations (FFDs) which are modelled by B-splines. In contrast to existing non-rigid registration methods based on FFDs the proposed diffeomorphic non-rigid registration algorithm based on free-form deformations (FFDs) which are modelled by B-splines. To construct a diffeomorphic transformation we compose a sequence of free-form deformations while ensuring that individual FFDs are one-to-one transformations. We have evaluated the algorithm on 20 normal brain MR images which have been manually segmented into 67 anatomical structures. Using the agreement between manual segmentation and segmentation propagation as a measure of registration quality we have compared the algorithm to an existing FFD registration algorithm and a modified FFD registration algorithm which penalises non-diffeomorphic transformations. The results show that the proposed algorithm generates diffeomorphic transformations while providing similar levels of performance as the existing FFD registration algorithm in terms of registration accuracy.},

@article{thevenaz1998,
	Abstract = {We present an automatic subpixel registration algorithm that minimizes the mean square intensity difference between a reference and a test data set, which can be either images (two-dimensional) or volumes (three-dimensional). It uses an explicit spline representation of the images in conjunction with spline processing, and is based on a coarse-to-fine iterative strategy (pyramid approach). The minimization is performed according to a new variation (ML*) of the Marquardt-Levenberg algorithm for nonlinear least-square optimization. The geometric deformation model is a global three-dimensional (3-D) affine transformation that can be optionally restricted to rigid-body motion (rotation and translation), combined with isometric scaling. It also includes an optional adjustment of image contrast differences. We obtain excellent results for the registration of intramodality positron emission tomography (PET) and functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) data. We conclude that the multiresolution refinement strategy is more robust than a comparable single-stage method, being less likely to be trapped into a false local optimum. In addition, our improved version of the Marquardt-Levenberg algorithm is faster.},

@article{rueckert1999,
	Abstract = {In this paper we present a new approach for the nonrigid registration of contrast-enhanced breast MRI. A hierarchical transformation model of the motion of the breast has been developed. The global motion of the breast is modeled by an affine transformation while the local breast motion is described by a free-form deformation (FFD) based on B-splines. Normalized mutual information is used as a voxel-based similarity measure which is insensitive to intensity changes as a result of the contrast enhancement. Registration is achieved by minimizing a cost function, which represents a combination of the cost associated with the smoothness of the transformation and the cost associated with the image similarity. The algorithm has been applied to the fully automated registration of three-dimensional (3-D) breast MRI in volunteers and patients. In particular, we have compared the results of the proposed nonrigid registration algorithm to those obtained using rigid and affine registration techniques. The results clearly indicate that the nonrigid registration algorithm is much better able to recover the motion and deformation of the breast than rigid or affine registration algorithms.},

@article{chun2009,
	Abstract = {Nonrigid image registration is an important task for many medical imaging applications. In particular, for radiation oncology it is desirable to track respiratory motion for thoracic cancer treatment. B-splines are convenient for modeling nonrigid deformations, but ensuring invertibility can be a challenge. This paper describes sufficient conditions for local invertibility of deformations based on B-spline bases. These sufficient conditions can be used with constrained optimization to enforce local invertibility. We also incorporate these conditions into nonrigid image registration methods based on a simple penalty approach that encourages diffeomorphic deformations. Traditional Jacobian penalty methods penalize negative Jacobian determinant values only at grid points. In contrast, our new method enforces a sufficient condition for invertibility directly on the deformation coefficients to encourage invertibility globally over a 3D continuous domain. The proposed penalty approach requires substantially less compute time than Jacobian penalties per iteration.},

@article{de-craene2011,
	Abstract = {This paper presents a new registration algorithm, called Temporal Diffeomorphic Free Form Deformation (TDFFD), and its application to motion and strain quantification from a sequence of 3D ultrasound (US) images. The originality of our approach resides in enforcing time consistency by representing the 4D velocity field as the sum of continuous spatiotemporal B-Spline kernels. The spatiotemporal displacement field is then recovered through forward Eulerian integration of the non-stationary velocity field. The strain tensor is computed locally using the spatial derivatives of the reconstructed displacement field. The energy functional considered in this paper weighs two terms: the image similarity and a regularization term. The image similarity metric is the sum of squared differences between the intensities of each frame and a reference one. Any frame in the sequence can be chosen as reference. The regularization term is based on the incompressibility of myocardial tissue. TDFFD was compared to pairwise 3D FFD and 3D+t FFD, both on displacement and velocity fields, on a set of synthetic 3D US images with different noise levels. TDFFD showed increased robustness to noise compared to these two state-of-the-art algorithms. TDFFD also proved to be more resistant to a reduced temporal resolution when decimating this synthetic sequence. Finally, this synthetic dataset was used to determine optimal settings of the TDFFD algorithm. Subsequently, TDFFD was applied to a database of cardiac 3D US images of the left ventricle acquired from 9 healthy volunteers and 13 patients treated by Cardiac Resynchronization Therapy (CRT). On healthy cases, uniform strain patterns were observed over all myocardial segments, as physiologically expected. On all CRT patients, the improvement in synchrony of regional longitudinal strain correlated with CRT clinical outcome as quantified by the reduction of end-systolic left ventricular volume at follow-up (6 and 12months), showing the potential of the proposed algorithm for the assessment of CRT.},

@article{tustison2009,
	Abstract = {Previous contributions to both the research and open source software communities detailed a generalization of a fast scalar field fitting technique for cubic B-splines based on the work originally proposed by Lee . One advantage of our proposed generalized B-spline fitting approach is its immediate application to a class of nonrigid registration techniques frequently employed in medical image analysis. Specifically, these registration techniques fall under the rubric of free-form deformation (FFD) approaches in which the object to be registered is embedded within a B-spline object. The deformation of the B-spline object describes the transformation of the image registration solution. Representative of this class of techniques, and often cited within the relevant community, is the formulation of Rueckert who employed cubic splines with normalized mutual information to study breast deformation. Similar techniques from various groups provided incremental novelty in the form of disparate explicit regularization terms, as well as the employment of various image metrics and tailored optimization methods. For several algorithms, the underlying gradient-based optimization retained the essential characteristics of Rueckert's original contribution. The contribution which we provide in this paper is two-fold: 1) the observation that the generic FFD framework is intrinsically susceptible to problematic energy topographies and 2) that the standard gradient used in FFD image registration can be modified to a well-understood preconditioned form which substantially improves performance. This is demonstrated with theoretical discussion and comparative evaluation experimentation.},
