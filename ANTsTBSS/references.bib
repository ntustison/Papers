  abstract = {Heavy marijuana use has well established long term consequences for
	cognition and mental health, but the effect on brain structure is
	less well understood. We used an MRI technique that is sensitive
	to the structural integrity of brain tissue combined with a white
	matter mapping tractography technique to investigate structural changes
	in the corpus callosum (CC). Diffusion tensor imaging (DTI) was obtained
	in eleven heavy marijuana users who started using marijuana in early
	adolescence and eleven age matched controls. Mean diffusivity (MD)
	and fractional anisotropy (FA) (which measure structural integrity
	and tract coherence, respectively) were analysed within the corpus
	callosum which was spatially defined using tractography and tract-based
	spatial statistics (TBSS). MD was significantly increased in marijuana
	users relative to controls in the region of the CC where white matter
	passes between the prefrontal lobes. This observation suggests impaired
	structural integrity affecting the fibre tracts of the CC and is
	in keeping with previous reports of altered and diversified activation
	patterns in marijuana users. There was a trend towards a positive
	correlation between MD and length of use suggesting the possibility
	of a cumulative effect of marijuana over time and that a younger
	age at onset of use may predispose individuals to structural white
	matter damage. Structural abnormalities revealed in the CC may underlie
	cognitive and behavioural consequences of long term heavy marijuana
	use.},

	is of no consequence when using actual data. We first review the

  abstract = {At its simplest, voxel-based morphometry (VBM) involves a voxel-wise
	comparison of the local concentration of gray matter between two
	groups of subjects. The procedure is relatively straightforward and
	involves spatially normalizing high-resolution images from all the
	subjects in the study into the same stereotactic space. This is followed
	by segmenting the gray matter from the spatially normalized images
	and smoothing the gray-matter segments. Voxel-wise parametric statistical
	tests which compare the smoothed gray-matter images from the two
	groups are performed. Corrections for multiple comparisons are made
	using the theory of Gaussian random fields. This paper describes
	the steps involved in VBM, with particular emphasis on segmenting
	gray matter from MR images with nonuniformity artifact. We provide
	evaluations of the assumptions that underpin the method, including

  abstract = {Diffusion tensor imaging (DTI) has become one of the most popular
	MRI techniques in brain research, as well as in clinical practice.
	The number of brain studies with DTI is growing steadily and, over
	the last decade, has produced more than 700 publications. Diffusion
	tensor imaging enables visualization and characterization of white
	matter fascicli in two and three dimensions. Since the introduction
	of this methodology in 1994, it has been used to study the white
	matter architecture and integrity of the normal and diseased brains
	(multiple sclerosis, stroke, aging, dementia, schizophrenia, etc.).
	Although it provided image contrast that was not available with routine
	MR techniques, unique information on white matter and 3D visualization
	of neuronal pathways, many questions were raised regarding the origin
	of the DTI signal. Diffusion tensor imaging is constantly validated,
	challenged, and developed in terms of acquisition scheme, image processing,
	analysis, and interpretation. While DTI offers a powerful tool to
	study and visualize white matter, it suffers from inherent artifacts
	and limitations. The partial volume effect and the inability of the
	model to cope with non-Gaussian diffusion are its two main drawbacks.
	Nevertheless, when combined with functional brain mapping, DTI provides
	an efficient tool for comprehensive, noninvasive, functional anatomy
	mapping of the human brain. This review summarizes the development
	of DTI in the last decade with respect to the specificity and utility
	of the technique in radiology and anatomy studies.},

  abstract = {Simulations provide a way of generating data where ground truth is
	known, enabling quantitative testing of image processing methods.
	In this paper, we present the construction of 20 realistic digital
	brain phantoms that can be used to simulate medical imaging data.
	The phantoms are made from 20 normal adults to take into account
	intersubject anatomical variabilities. Each digital brain phantom
	was created by registering and averaging four T1, T2, and proton
	density (PD)-weighted magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) scans from
	each subject. A fuzzy minimum distance classification was used to
	classify voxel intensities from T1, T2, and PD average volumes into
	grey-matter, white matter, cerebro-spinal fluid, and fat. Automatically
	generated mask volumes were required to separate brain from nonbrain
	structures and ten fuzzy tissue volumes were created: grey matter,
	white matter, cerebro-spinal fluid, skull, marrow within the bone,
	dura, fat, tissue around the fat, muscles, and skin/muscles. A fuzzy
	vessel class was also obtained from the segmentation of the magnetic
	resonance angiography scan of the subject. These eleven fuzzy volumes
	that describe the spatial distribution of anatomical tissues define
	the digital phantom, where voxel intensity is proportional to the
	fraction of tissue within the voxel. These fuzzy volumes can be used
	to drive simulators for different modalities including MRI, PET,
	or SPECT. These phantoms were used to construct 20 simulated T1-weighted
	MR scans. To evaluate the realism of these simulations, we propose
	two approaches to compare them to real data acquired with the same
	acquisition parameters. The first approach consists of comparing
	the intensities within the segmented classes in both real and simulated
	data. In the second approach, a whole brain voxel-wise comparison
	between simulations and real T1-weighted data is performed. The first
	comparison underlines that segmented classes appear to properly represent
	the anatomy on average, and that inside these classes, the simulated
	and real intensity values are quite similar. The second comparison
	enables the study of the regional variations with no a priori class.
	The experiments demonstrate that these variations are small when
	real data are corrected for intensity nonuniformity.},

	we develop a novel symmetric image normalization method (SyN) for

	Our evaluation uses gold standard, human cortical segmentation to

	the standard ITK implementation of Thirion's Demons algorithm. The
	new method compares favorably with both approaches, in particular
	when the distance between the template brain and the target brain
	is large. We then report the correlation of volumes gained by algorithmic
	cortical labelings of FTD and control subjects with those gained
	by the manual rater. This comparison shows that, of the three methods
	tested, SyN's volume measurements are the most strongly correlated

	detail the ANTs implementation of three similarity metrics: squared
	intensity difference, a new and faster cross-correlation, and voxel-wise
	mutual information. We then use two-fold cross-validation to compare
	their performance on openly available, manually labeled, T1-weighted
	MRI brain image data of 40 subjects (UCLA's LPBA40 dataset). We report
	evaluation results on cortical and whole brain labels for both the

	that the best ANTs methods are competitive with existing brain extraction
	results (Jaccard=0.958) and cortical labeling approaches. Mutual

	mapping gave the best cortical labeling results (Jaccard=0.669±0.022).
	Furthermore, our two-fold cross-validation allows us to quantify

  abstract = {Quantitative-diffusion-tensor MRI consists of deriving and displaying
	parameters that resemble histological or physiological stains, i.e.,
	that characterize intrinsic features of tissue microstructure and
	microdynamics. Specifically, these parameters are objective, and
	insensitive to the choice of laboratory coordinate system. Here,
	these two properties are used to derive intravoxel measures of diffusion
	isotropy and the degree of diffusion anisotropy, as well as intervoxel
	measures of structural similarity, and fiber-tract organization from
	the effective diffusion tensor, D, which is estimated in each voxel.
	First, D is decomposed into its isotropic and anisotropic parts,
	[D] I and D - [D] I, respectively (where [D] = Trace(D)/3 is the
	mean diffusivity, and I is the identity tensor). Then, the tensor
	(dot) product operator is used to generate a family of new rotationally
	and translationally invariant quantities. Finally, maps of these
	quantitative parameters are produced from high-resolution diffusion
	tensor images (in which D is estimated in each voxel from a series
	of 2D-FT spin-echo diffusion-weighted images) in living cat brain.
	Due to the high inherent sensitivity of these parameters to changes
	in tissue architecture (i.e., macromolecular, cellular, tissue, and
	organ structure) and in its physiologic state, their potential applications
	include monitoring structural changes in development, aging, and

  abstract = {Although it is being successfully implemented for exploration of the
	genome, discovery science has eluded the functional neuroimaging
	community. The core challenge remains the development of common paradigms
	for interrogating the myriad functional systems in the brain without
	the constraints of a priori hypotheses. Resting-state functional
	MRI (R-fMRI) constitutes a candidate approach capable of addressing
	this challenge. Imaging the brain during rest reveals large-amplitude
	spontaneous low-frequency (<0.1 Hz) fluctuations in the fMRI signal
	that are temporally correlated across functionally related areas.
	Referred to as functional connectivity, these correlations yield
	detailed maps of complex neural systems, collectively constituting
	an individual's "functional connectome." Reproducibility across datasets
	and individuals suggests the functional connectome has a common architecture,
	yet each individual's functional connectome exhibits unique features,
	with stable, meaningful interindividual differences in connectivity
	patterns and strengths. Comprehensive mapping of the functional connectome,
	and its subsequent exploitation to discern genetic influences and
	brain-behavior relationships, will require multicenter collaborative
	datasets. Here we initiate this endeavor by gathering R-fMRI data
	from 1,414 volunteers collected independently at 35 international
	centers. We demonstrate a universal architecture of positive and
	negative functional connections, as well as consistent loci of inter-individual
	variability. Age and sex emerged as significant determinants. These
	results demonstrate that independent R-fMRI datasets can be aggregated
	and shared. High-throughput R-fMRI can provide quantitative phenotypes
	for molecular genetic studies and biomarkers of developmental and
	pathological processes in the brain. To initiate discovery science
	of brain function, the 1000 Functional Connectomes Project dataset

	analyses were performed to investigate whether NAWM FA or GM volume

	tract, the left and right thalamus with the corresponding thalamic
	radiations and the left insula with the adjacent WM). Either the

	revealed that the TBI group scored generally lower than the control
	group on the SOT, indicative of deficits in postural control. In

	typically designed for specific regions of interest. To analyze changes
	in these regions traditional statistical methods are often employed
	to elucidate group differences which are measured against the variability

  abstract = {In both diagnostic and research applications, the interpretation of
	MR images of the human brain is facilitated when different data sets

	Quantitative analysis with predefined atlas templates often requires
	the initial alignment of atlas and image planes. Unfortunately, the
	axial planes acquired during separate scanning sessions are often
	different in their relative position and orientation, and these slices
	are not coplanar with those in the atlas. We have developed a completely
	automatic method to register a given volumetric data set with Talairach
	stereotaxic coordinate system.The registration method is based on
	multi-scale, three-dimensional (3D) cross-correlation with an average
	(n > 300) MR brain image volume aligned with the Talariach stereotaxic
	space. Once the data set is re-sampled by the transformation recovered
	by the algorithm, atlas slices can be directly superimposed on the
	corresponding slices of the re-sampled volume. the use of such a
	standardized space also allows the direct comparison, voxel to voxel,
	of two or more data sets brought into stereotaxic space.With use
	of a two-tailed Student t test for paired samples, there was no significant
	difference in the transformation parameters recovered by the automatic
	algorithm when compared with two manual landmark-based methods (p
	> 0.1 for all parameters except y-scale, where p > 0.05). Using root-mean-square
	difference between normalized voxel intensities as an unbiased measure
	of registration, we show that when estimated and averaged over 60
	volumetric MR images in standard space, this measure was 30\% lower
	for the automatic technique than the manual method, indicating better
	registrations. Likewise, the automatic method showed a 57\% reduction
	in standard deviation, implying a more stable technique. The algorithm
	is able to recover the transformation even when data are missing
	from the top or bottom of the volume.We present a fully automatic
	registration method to map volumetric data into stereotaxic space
	that yields results comparable with those of manually based techniques.
	The method requires no manual identification of points or contours

  abstract = {A variety of voxel-based morphometric analysis methods have been adopted
	by the neuroimaging community in the recent years. In this commentary
	we describe why voxel-based statistics, which are commonly used to
	construct statistical parametric maps, are very limited in characterizing
	morphological differences between groups, and why the effectiveness
	of voxel-based statistics is significantly biased toward group differences
	that are highly localized in space and of linear nature, whereas
	it is significantly reduced in cases with group differences of similar
	or even higher magnitude, when these differences are spatially complex
	and subtle. The complex and often subtle and nonlinear ways in which
	various factors, such as age, sex, genotype and disease, can affect
	brain morphology, suggest that alternative, unbiased methods based
	on statistical learning theory might be able to better quantify brain
	changes that are due to a variety of factors, especially when relationships
	between brain networks, rather than individual structures, and disease
	are examined.},

  abstract = {In this study, an implicit reference group-wise (IRG) registration
	with a small deformation, linear elastic model was used to jointly
	estimate correspondences between a set of MRI images. The performance
	of pair-wise and group-wise registration algorithms was evaluated
	for spatial normalization of structural and functional MRI data.
	Traditional spatial normalization is accomplished by group-to-reference
	(G2R) registration in which a group of images are registered pair-wise
	to a reference image. G2R registration is limited due to bias associated
	with selecting a reference image. In contrast, implicit reference
	group-wise (IRG) registration estimates correspondences between a
	group of images by jointly registering the images to an implicit
	reference corresponding to the group average. The implicit reference
	is estimated during IRG registration eliminating the bias associated
	with selecting a specific reference image. Registration performance
	was evaluated using segmented T1-weighted magnetic resonance images
	from the Nonrigid Image Registration Evaluation Project (NIREP),
	DTI and fMRI images. Implicit reference pair-wise (IRP) registration-a
	special case of IRG registration for two images-is shown to produce
	better relative overlap than IRG for pair-wise registration using
	the same small deformation, linear elastic registration model. However,
	IRP-G2R registration is shown to have significant transitivity error,
	i.e., significant inconsistencies between correspondences defined
	by different pair-wise transformations. In contrast, IRG registration
	produces consistent correspondence between images in a group at the
	cost of slightly reduced pair-wise RO accuracy compared to IRP-G2R.
	IRG spatial normalization of the fractional anisotropy (FA) maps
	of DTI is shown to have smaller FA variance compared with G2R methods
	using the same elastic registration model. Analyses of fMRI data
	sets with sensorimotor and visual tasks show that IRG registration,
	on average, increases the statistical detectability of brain activation
	compared to G2R registration.},

	normalization, data are smoothed to improve the validity of statistical
	inferences and to reduce inter-individual variation. However, the
	size of the smoothing filter used for VBM of DT-MRI data is highly
	variable across studies. For example, a literature review revealed
	that Gaussian smoothing kernels ranging in size (full width at half
	maximum) from zero to 16 mm have been used in DT-MRI VBM type studies.
	To investigate the effect of varying filter size in such analyses,
	whole brain DT-MRI data from 14 schizophrenic patients were compared

	size was varied from zero to 16 mm. Within this range of smoothing,
	four different conclusions regarding apparent patient control differences

	reduced FA in right superior temporal gyrus (STG) in patients; (iii)
	reduced FA in both right STG and left cerebellum in patients; and

	and Alzheimer's disease (AD)/mild cognitive impairment (MCI). In
	patients with schizophrenia, VBM approach detects the structural
	brain abnormalities that appear normal on conventional MRI. Moreover,
	this technique also has the potential to emerge as a useful clinical
	tool for early detection and monitoring of disease progression and
	treatment response in patients with schizophrenia or AD/MCI. In TLE,
	VBM approach may help elucidate some unresolved important research
	questions such as how recurrent temporal lobe seizures affect hippocampal
	and extrahippocampal morphology. Thus, in the future, large cohort
	studies to monitor whole brain changes on a VBM basis will lead to
	a further understanding of the neuropathology of several conditions.},

	MD in the amygdala and decreased FA in the inferior longitudinal
	fasciculus (ILF). ILF diffusivity was associated with the presence
	of visual hallucinations (p = 0.007), and amygdala diffusivity was
	associated with Unified Parkinson's Disease Rating Scale (r = 0.50;
	p = 0.005) in DLB. In contrast, patients with AD were characterized
	by elevated MD in the medial temporal, temporal, and parietal lobe

  abstract = {Traumatic brain injury (TBI) is one of the most common causes of long-term
	disability. Despite the importance of identifying neuropathology
	in individuals with chronic TBI, methodological challenges posed
	at the stage of inter-subject image registration have hampered previous
	voxel-based MRI studies from providing a clear pattern of structural
	atrophy after TBI. We used a novel symmetric diffeomorphic image
	normalization method to conduct a tensor-based morphometry (TBM)
	study of TBI. The key advantage of this method is that it simultaneously
	estimates an optimal template brain and topology preserving deformations
	between this template and individual subject brains. Detailed patterns
	of atrophies are then revealed by statistically contrasting control
	and subject deformations to the template space. Participants were
	29 survivors of TBI and 20 control subjects who were matched in terms
	of age, gender, education, and ethnicity. Localized volume losses
	were found most prominently in white matter regions and the subcortical
	nuclei including the thalamus, the midbrain, the corpus callosum,
	the mid- and posterior cingulate cortices, and the caudate. Significant
	voxel-wise volume loss clusters were also detected in the cerebellum
	and the frontal/temporal neocortices. Volume enlargements were identified
	largely in ventricular regions. A similar pattern of results was
	observed in a subgroup analysis where we restricted our analysis
	to the 17 TBI participants who had no macroscopic focal lesions (total
	lesion volume >1.5 cm(3)). The current study confirms, extends, and
	partly challenges previous structural MRI studies in chronic TBI.
	By demonstrating that a large deformation image registration technique
	can be successfully combined with TBM to identify TBI-induced diffuse
	structural changes with greater precision, our approach is expected
	to increase the sensitivity of future studies examining brain-behavior
	relationships in the TBI population.},

  abstract = {All fields of neuroscience that employ brain imaging need to communicate
	their results with reference to anatomical regions. In particular,
	comparative morphometry and group analysis of functional and physiological
	data require coregistration of brains to establish correspondences
	across brain structures. It is well established that linear registration
	of one brain to another is inadequate for aligning brain structures,
	so numerous algorithms have emerged to nonlinearly register brains
	to one another. This study is the largest evaluation of nonlinear
	deformation algorithms applied to brain image registration ever conducted.
	Fourteen algorithms from laboratories around the world are evaluated
	using 8 different error measures. More than 45,000 registrations
	between 80 manually labeled brains were performed by algorithms including:
	AIR, ANIMAL, ART, Diffeomorphic Demons, FNIRT, IRTK, JRD-fluid, ROMEO,
	SICLE, SyN, and four different SPM5 algorithms ("SPM2-type" and regular
	Normalization, Unified Segmentation, and the DARTEL Toolbox). All
	of these registrations were preceded by linear registration between
	the same image pairs using FLIRT. One of the most significant findings
	of this study is that the relative performances of the registration
	methods under comparison appear to be little affected by the choice
	of subject population, labeling protocol, and type of overlap measure.
	This is important because it suggests that the findings are generalizable
	to new subject populations that are labeled or evaluated using different
	labeling protocols. Furthermore, we ranked the 14 methods according
	to three completely independent analyses (permutation tests, one-way
	ANOVA tests, and indifference-zone ranking) and derived three almost
	identical top rankings of the methods. ART, SyN, IRTK, and SPM's
	DARTEL Toolbox gave the best results according to overlap and distance
	measures, with ART and SyN delivering the most consistently high
	accuracy across subjects and label sets. Updates will be published

  abstract = {Traumatic brain injury (TBI) is a serious public health problem. Even
	injuries classified as mild, the most common, can result in persistent
	neurobehavioural impairment. Diffuse axonal injury is a common finding
	after TBI, and is presumed to contribute to outcomes, but may not
	always be apparent using standard neuroimaging. Diffusion tensor
	imaging (DTI) is a more recent method of assessing axonal integrity
	in vivo. The primary objective of the current investigation was to
	characterize white matter integrity utilizing DTI across the spectrum
	of chronic TBI of all severities. A secondary objective was to examine
	the relationship between white matter integrity and cognition. Twenty
	mild, 17 moderate to severe TBI and 18 controls underwent DTI and
	neuropsychological testing. Fractional anisotropy, axial diffusivity
	and radial diffusivity were calculated from the DTI data. Fractional
	anisotropy was the primary measure of white matter integrity. Region
	of interest analysis included anterior and posterior corona radiata,
	cortico-spinal tracts, cingulum fibre bundles, external capsule,
	forceps minor and major, genu, body and splenium of the corpus callosum,
	inferior fronto-occipital fasciculus, superior longitudinal fasciculus
	and sagittal stratum. Cognitive domain scores were calculated from
	executive, attention and memory testing. Decreased fractional anisotropy
	was found in all 13 regions of interest for the moderate to severe
	TBI group, but only in the cortico-spinal tract, sagittal stratum
	and superior longitudinal fasciculus for the mild TBI group. White
	Matter Load (a measure of the total number of regions with reduced
	FA) was negatively correlated with all cognitive domains. Analysis
	of radial and axial diffusivity values suggested that all severities
	of TBI can result in a degree of axonal damage, while irreversible
	myelin damage was only apparent for moderate to severe TBI. The present
	data emphasize that white matter changes exist on a spectrum, including
	mild TBI. An index of global white matter neuropathology (White Matter
	Load) was related to cognitive function, such that greater white
	matter pathology predicted greater cognitive deficits. Mechanistically,
	mild TBI white matter changes may be primarily due to axonal damage
	as opposed to myelin damage. The more severe injuries impact both.
	DTI provides an objective means for determining the relationship
	of cognitive deficits to TBI, even in cases where the injury was
	sustained years prior to the evaluation.},

  abstract = {Diffusion tensor imaging (DTI) studies in schizophrenia demonstrate
	lower anisotropic diffusion within white matter due either to loss
	of coherence of white matter fiber tracts, to changes in the number
	and/or density of interconnecting fiber tracts, or to changes in
	myelination, although methodology as well as localization of such
	changes differ between studies. The aim of this study is to localize
	and to specify further DTI abnormalities in schizophrenia by combining
	DTI with magnetization transfer imaging (MTI), a technique sensitive
	to myelin and axonal alterations in order to increase specificity
	of DTI findings. 21 chronic schizophrenics and 26 controls were scanned
	using Line-Scan-Diffusion-Imaging and T1-weighted techniques with
	and without a saturation pulse (MT). Diffusion information was used
	to normalize co-registered maps of fractional anisotropy (FA) and
	magnetization transfer ratio (MTR) to a study-specific template,
	using the multi-channel daemon algorithm, designed specifically to
	deal with multidirectional tensor information. Diffusion anisotropy
	was decreased in schizophrenia in the following brain regions: the
	fornix, the corpus callosum, bilaterally in the cingulum bundle,
	bilaterally in the superior occipito-frontal fasciculus, bilaterally
	in the internal capsule, in the right inferior occipito-frontal fasciculus
	and the left arcuate fasciculus. MTR maps demonstrated changes in
	the corpus callosum, fornix, right internal capsule, and the superior
	occipito-frontal fasciculus bilaterally; however, no changes were
	noted in the anterior cingulum bundle, the left internal capsule,
	the arcuate fasciculus, or inferior occipito-frontal fasciculus.
	In addition, the right posterior cingulum bundle showed MTR but not
	FA changes in schizophrenia. These findings suggest that, while some
	of the diffusion abnormalities in schizophrenia are likely due to
	abnormal coherence, or organization of the fiber tracts, some of
	these abnormalities may, in fact, be attributed to or coincide with
	myelin/axonal disruption.},

	information. Based on these capabilities of DTI, many new image analysis
	tools are being developed to investigate the status of the white

	patients with schizophrenia using a novel voxel-based tensor analysis
	applied to fractional anisotropy (FA) of the diffusion tensor. Our
	voxel-based approach, which requires precise spatial normalization
	to remove the misalignment of fiber tracts, includes generating a
	symmetrical group average template of the diffusion tensor by applying
	nonlinear elastic warping of the demons algorithm. We then normalized
	all 32 diffusion tensor MRIs from healthy subjects and 23 from schizophrenic
	subjects to the symmetrical average template. For each brain, six
	channels of tensor component images and one T2-weighted image were
	used for registration to match tensor orientation and shape between
	images. A statistical evaluation of white matter asymmetry was then
	conducted on the normalized FA images and their flipped images. In
	controls, we found left-higher-than-right anisotropic asymmetry in
	the anterior part of the corpus callosum, cingulum bundle, the optic
	radiation, and the superior cerebellar peduncle, and right-higher-than-left
	anisotropic asymmetry in the anterior limb of the internal capsule
	and the anterior limb's prefrontal regions, in the uncinate fasciculus,
	and in the superior longitudinal fasciculus. In patients, the asymmetry
	was lower, although still present, in the cingulum bundle and the
	anterior corpus callosum, and not found in the anterior limb of the
	internal capsule, the uncinate fasciculus, and the superior cerebellar
	peduncle compared to healthy subjects. These findings of anisotropic
	asymmetry pattern differences between healthy controls and patients
	with schizophrenia are likely related to neurodevelopmental abnormalities

  abstract = {BACKGROUND: Diffusion tensor imaging (DTI) has been shown to be sensitive
	in detecting white matter differences between sexes. Before cross-sex
	hormone treatment female to male transsexuals (FtM) differ from females
	but not from males in several brain fibers. The purpose of this paper
	is to investigate whether white matter patterns in male to female
	(MtF) transsexuals before commencing cross-sex hormone treatment
	are also more similar to those of their biological sex or whether
	they are more similar to those of their gender identity. METHOD:
	DTI was performed in 18 MtF transsexuals and 19 male and 19 female
	controls scanned with a 3 T Trio Tim Magneton. Fractional anisotropy
	(FA) was performed on white matter of the whole brain, which was
	spatially analyzed using Tract-Based Spatial Statistics. RESULTS:
	MtF transsexuals differed from both male and female controls bilaterally
	in the superior longitudinal fasciculus, the right anterior cingulum,
	the right forceps minor, and the right corticospinal tract. CONCLUSIONS:
	Our results show that the white matter microstructure pattern in
	untreated MtF transsexuals falls halfway between the pattern of male
	and female controls. The nature of these differences suggests that
	some fasciculi do not complete the masculinization process in MtF
	transsexuals during brain development.},

  abstract = {Current optimal MRI identifies a relevant structural abnormality in
	up to 80\% of patients with refractory partial seizures. Identification
	of a structural lesion is fundamental to pre-surgical evaluation.
	We used diffusion tensor imaging (DTI) and statistical parametric
	mapping (SPM) to examine objectively the diffusion properties, and
	hence structural organization, of cerebral tissue in 10 patients
	with partial seizures and acquired lesions and 30 patients with partial
	seizures and normal MRI. Fractional anisotropy and mean diffusivity
	maps were calculated and, using SPM, individual patients were compared
	with a group of 30 control subjects. Diffusion tensor imaging and
	voxel-by-voxel statistical comparisons identified significant increases
	in diffusivity and significant reductions of anisotropy in all patients
	with acquired non-progressive cerebral lesions and partial seizures.
	In all of these patients, the areas of increased diffusivity, and
	in nine patients the areas of decreased anisotropy, concurred with
	abnormalities identified on visual inspection of conventional MRI.
	In addition, there were 10 areas which were normal on conventional
	imaging which exhibited abnormal anisotropy or diffusivity. Individual
	analyses of the 30 patients with partial seizures and normal optimal
	MRI identified a significant increase in diffusivity in eight of
	the subjects. In six of these, the areas of increased diffusivity
	concurred with the localization of epileptiform EEG abnormality.
	Analysis of anisotropy in the MRI-negative patients revealed significant
	differences in two patients, one of which concurred with electroclinical
	seizure localization. Group analysis of nine patients with normal
	conventional MRI and electroclinical seizure onset localizing to
	the left temporal region revealed a significant increase in diffusivity
	and a significant reduction in anisotropy within the white matter
	of the left temporal lobe. DTI analysed using SPM was sensitive in
	patients with acquired cerebral damage. Significant differences in
	the diffusion indices in individual MRI negative patients and the
	group effect in patients with left temporal lobe epilepsy suggest
	that minor structural disorganization exists in occult epileptogenic
	cerebral lesions. These techniques are promising, non-invasive imaging
	methods for identifying the cause of partial seizures, and can contribute
	to pre-surgical evaluation.},

	imaging to provide information about anatomical connectivity in the
	brain, by measuring the anisotropic diffusion of water in white matter
	tracts. One of the measures most commonly derived from diffusion
	data is fractional anisotropy (FA), which quantifies how strongly
	directional the local tract structure is. Many imaging studies are
	starting to use FA images in voxelwise statistical analyses, in order
	to localise brain changes related to development, degeneration and

	solution to the question of how to align FA images from multiple
	subjects in a way that allows for valid conclusions to be drawn from
	the subsequent voxelwise analysis. Furthermore, the arbitrariness
	of the choice of spatial smoothing extent has not yet been resolved.
	In this paper, we present a new method that aims to solve these issues
	via (a) carefully tuned non-linear registration, followed by (b)
	projection onto an alignment-invariant tract representation (the
	"mean FA skeleton"). We refer to this new approach as Tract-Based

	being optical flow techniques. We use the concept of diffusing models
	to derive three different non-rigid matching algorithms, one using

  abstract = {Diffuse traumatic axonal injury (TAI) is a type of traumatic brain
	injury (TBI) characterized predominantly by white matter damage.
	While TAI is associated with cerebral atrophy, the relationship between
	gray matter volumes and TAI of afferent or efferent axonal pathways
	remains unknown. Moreover, it is unclear if deficits in cognition
	are associated with post-traumatic brain volumes in particular regions.
	The goal of this study was to determine the relationship between
	markers of TAI and volumes of cortical and subcortical structures,
	while also assessing the relationship between cognitive outcomes
	and regional brain volumes. High-resolution magnetic resonance imaging
	scans were performed in 24 patients with TAI within 1 week of injury
	and were repeated 8 months later. Diffusion tensor imaging (DTI)
	tractography was used to reconstruct prominent white matter tracts
	and calculate their fractional anisotropy (FA) and mean diffusivity
	(MD) values. Regional brain volumes were computed using semi-automated
	morphometric analysis. Pearson's correlation coefficients were used
	to assess associations between brain volumes, white matter integrity
	(i.e., FA and MD), and neuropsychological outcomes. Post-traumatic
	volumes of many gray matter structures were associated with chronic
	damage to related white matter tracts, and less strongly associated
	with measures of white matter integrity in the acute scans. For example,
	left and right hippocampal volumes correlated with FA in the fornix
	body (r = 0.600, p = 0.001; r = 0.714, p < 0.001, respectively).
	In addition, regional brain volumes were associated with deficits
	in corresponding neuropsychological domains. Our results suggest
	that TAI may be a primary mechanism of post-traumatic atrophy, and
	provide support for regional morphometry as a biomarker for cognitive
	outcome after injury.},

	the use of high-dimensional normalization approaches by generating

	with low-dimensional approaches can result in insufficient removal
	of shape differences which in turn can confound FA differences in
	a complex manner, and that utilizing high-dimensional normalization
	can both significantly minimize the confounding effect of shape differences
	to FA differences and provide a more complete description of WM differences
	in terms of both size and tissue architecture differences. We also
	found that high-dimensional approaches, by leveraging full tensor
	features instead of tensor-derived indices, can further improve the

  abstract = {The finite mixture (FM) model is the most commonly used model for
	statistical segmentation of brain magnetic resonance (MR) images
	because of its simple mathematical form and the piecewise constant
	nature of ideal brain MR images. However, being a histogram-based
	model, the FM has an intrinsic limitation--no spatial information
	is taken into account. This causes the FM model to work only on well-defined
	images with low levels of noise; unfortunately, this is often not
	the the case due to artifacts such as partial volume effect and bias
	field distortion. Under these conditions, FM model-based methods
	produce unreliable results. In this paper, we propose a novel hidden
	Markov random field (HMRF) model, which is a stochastic process generated
	by a MRF whose state sequence cannot be observed directly but which
	can be indirectly estimated through observations. Mathematically,
	it can be shown that the FM model is a degenerate version of the
	HMRF model. The advantage of the HMRF model derives from the way
	in which the spatial information is encoded through the mutual influences
	of neighboring sites. Although MRF modeling has been employed in
	MR image segmentation by other researchers, most reported methods
	are limited to using MRF as a general prior in an FM model-based
	approach. To fit the HMRF model, an EM algorithm is used. We show
	that by incorporating both the HMRF model and the EM algorithm into
	a HMRF-EM framework, an accurate and robust segmentation can be achieved.
	More importantly, the HMRF-EM framework can easily be combined with
	other techniques. As an example, we show how the bias field correction
	algorithm of Guillemaud and Brady (1997) can be incorporated into
	this framework to achieve a three-dimensional fully automated approach
	for brain MR image segmentation.},
